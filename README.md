# 🧠 Machine Learning Implementation

Welcome! This repository is a growing collection of machine learning model implementations built using Python and scikit-learn. Each project focuses on solving real-world problems using various algorithms and evaluation metrics.

Whether you're a beginner exploring ML or someone looking for quick references, this space is meant to be simple, clear, and practical.

## 📂 What's Inside

- ✅ Supervised Learning Models (Regression & Classification)
- ✅ Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, MSE, R², ROC, AUC)
- ✅ Clean, well-commented Python code
- ✅ Real datasets (California Housing, Breast Cancer, etc.)

## 🔍 Current Implementations

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Random Forest Regressor
- And more coming soon...

## 🚀 What's Coming Next

I'm actively working on **Streamlit-powered ML interfaces** – turning these models into interactive web apps.  
These will be available in a separate folder: [`streamlit-ml-interfaces`](https://github.com/AnvayHadkar/streamlit-ml-interfaces) *(coming soon!)*  
Stay tuned!

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. Clone the repo  
   `git clone https://github.com/AnvayHadkar/Machine-Learning-Implementation.git`
